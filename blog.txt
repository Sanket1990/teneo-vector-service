3 Days in Prague: A Fairytale Escape with Full Costs & Tips
If there’s one city that truly looks like it leapt out of a storybook, it’s Prague. From its gothic spires to the winding cobblestone streets, Prague feels like a dream that slowly unfolds with every step.
I had the chance to spend 3 magical nights in Prague, and in this post, I’m sharing not just my experience but also all the practical details: where I stayed, where I ate, what it cost — and some tips along the way.

So, let’s dive in!

Day 1: Arrival & First Taste of Prague
I landed in Prague on March 27th, around 10:15 in the morning, coming in from Munich. The airport is pretty well connected, and I opted for an Uber straight to my hotel. It cost me 420 CZK (~17 EUR) — a smooth 30-minute ride, with charming views already beginning as we entered the city.

For accommodation, I chose Hotel Golden Crown, right in the heart of the city. I paid 7,200 CZK (~285 EUR) for 3 nights, including breakfast. Honestly, the location couldn’t have been better — a few minutes’ walk from Wenceslas Square, and close to all the major sights. The room was comfortable, clean, and had those classic Prague windows that made mornings feel special.

After checking in and dropping my bags, my stomach reminded me it was lunchtime. I headed straight to Mlejnice Restaurant, a cozy place tucked away in the Old Town.
I ordered their famous beef goulash served in a bread bowl (280 CZK), paired with a local dark beer (60 CZK). Nothing like hearty Czech comfort food to start the trip!

With new energy, I wandered the Old Town Square, waited for the Astronomical Clock to strike the hour, and let myself get lost in the maze of medieval streets. As the sun began to dip, I made my way to the Charles Bridge. Seeing the sunset here is almost a rite of passage — and I can confirm, it’s as magical as they say.

For dinner, I found myself at Lokal Dlouhááá, a recommendation from a local friend. Their svíčková (marinated beef with creamy sauce and dumplings) paired beautifully with a chilled Pilsner Urquell. The bill? A very reasonable 360 CZK (~14 EUR).

Day 2: Castles, Cathedrals & Riverside Dining
The hotel breakfast spread was impressive — fresh pastries, cheeses, eggs, and great coffee to fuel the day.

I dedicated my second day to exploring Prague Castle. I bought the full access ticket for 450 CZK (~18 EUR), which gave me entry to St. Vitus Cathedral, Golden Lane, and more. The panoramic views of the city from up here are absolutely breathtaking.

Lunchtime found me at Café Lobkowicz, right within the castle complex. I went for their crispy chicken schnitzel with potato salad, washed down with a refreshing lemonade — a satisfying meal for 410 CZK (~16 EUR).

In the afternoon, I explored Malá Strana (Lesser Town), stumbled upon charming bookshops, and admired the colorful John Lennon Wall. I then took a peaceful break at Kampa Park, just sitting by the riverside and soaking in the views.

Dinner that night was a bit of a splurge at the riverside Kampa Park Restaurant. I treated myself to grilled salmon with asparagus and a glass of white wine. Pricey, yes — 1,200 CZK (~47 EUR) — but the view of the illuminated Charles Bridge while dining? Worth every crown.

Day 3: Markets, Museums & River Views
By now, I had found a nice rhythm in the city. After breakfast, I spent the morning in the Jewish Quarter. I bought a ticket for 500 CZK (~19.50 EUR), which gave access to several synagogues and the hauntingly beautiful Old Jewish Cemetery. Walking through this part of Prague was deeply moving.

For lunch, I visited the trendy Sisters Bistro in the Gourmet Passage. Their modern take on Czech open sandwiches was fantastic. I tried the beetroot tartare and herring, along with fresh juice — all for 260 CZK (~10 EUR).

In the afternoon, I took a leisurely Vltava River cruise (highly recommended!). For 400 CZK (~15.50 EUR), I enjoyed an hour of relaxing sightseeing from the water, seeing Prague’s skyline from a whole new perspective.

Of course, I had to make a coffee stop at the elegant Café Savoy. A slice of their famous Medovnik honey cake and a cappuccino set me back 210 CZK (~8 EUR) — and gave me the sugar boost I needed for my final evening.

For my last dinner in Prague, I kept things cozy and traditional at V Kolkovně, a bustling local favorite. I went for roast pork with sauerkraut and dumplings, plus a pint of Kozel beer — all for 350 CZK (~13.50 EUR).

Departure: Na shledanou, Praha!
On March 30th, after a final breakfast at the hotel, I packed my bags and ordered an Uber to the airport for 400 CZK (~16 EUR). Watching the city slip away through the window, I already found myself missing its timeless beauty.
